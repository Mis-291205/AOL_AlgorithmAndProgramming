Making C program that is a menu-driven data management system for a CSV file (fileaol.csv) that stores housing information. It uses a DataRow struct to store each row of data (with 8 columns like Location, City, Price, Rooms, Bathrooms, Carpark, Type, and Furnish) inside a global array. The program provides several options: (1) Display data, where the user can print a specified number of rows in a neatly aligned table; (2) Search data, which looks for a specific value inside a chosen column and prints the matching rows; (3) Sort data, which sorts rows by a chosen column in ascending or descending order using merge sort, then displays the top 10 results; and (4) Export data, which writes either the original or sorted dataset into a new CSV file chosen by the user. The program keeps running in a loop until the user selects option 5 (Exit).
